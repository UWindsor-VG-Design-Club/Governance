# Quorum for Board Meetings

1. The following shall be adopted as part of the Rules of Order and Procedure of the Board

## Rule

2. The quorum for any meeting of the Board shall be one half of the board members, and no meeting of the Board shall be convened unless one half of the board members are present. 

3. If the President shall decide upon a particular date and time for a meeting, or through some mechanism, determine that date or time, then the president shall ensure in good faith that a sufficient number of board members are able to be present at the meeting to constitute a quorum.

4. For greater certainty, if the number of members of the board is even, then exactly one half of those members consistutes a quorum and one half plus one is not required to convene a meeting.

5. For any particular meeting, the Presiding Officer of the meeting may direct a quorum requirement which exceeds this requirement. Such a meeting shall not be convened if the directed quorum is not met.

## Changes to quorum requirements

6. The quorum requirement may be changed by the Board at any time by simple-majority.

7. For greater certainty, an action to change the quorum requirement is a procedural action for the purposes of Rule 1.
