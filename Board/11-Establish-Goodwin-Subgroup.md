## Schedule 1 - Description of Subgroup and project

From Professor Goodwin:

> When I posted the idea in my class, I didn’t have anything formal in mind. The idea was to see if there was anyone interested in working on refining the AI Game Library developed for COMP-4770 or produce a similar Game Library for COMP-3770. I wasn’t planning on any regular meetings or deadlines.
> What I’m currently thinking is to develop the building blocks of an RPG which would be used in the final project for COMP-3770. (Last year, we did a 4 person multiplayer networked game).
> The building blocks would possible include:
> Character movement
> Camera control (1st, 3rd, overhead)
> Minimap
> Inventory system
> Combat system (melee, ranged, magic)
> Particle effects
> Scene management / map generation / levels
> Simple enemy control (no sophisticated AI – that’s left to COMP-4770)
> Object collection / interaction / puzzles
> Dialogue system
> Character abilities / progression / tech tree / experience system
> UI
> Etc.
